All known events. Please update this file when you design a new one ;)
Note, please don't ever choose an event ID number by hand D: I can't
guarentee it will be the same number even between runs. Use
Events::Event::createEventId(name) to get the ID, and save it statically
because the number won't change per run.

update
  Data type: Events::UpdateEvent

  Happens every frame regardless of other states. This event cannot
  be handled. Most components shouldn't need to use this event.

draw
  Data type: nullptr

  Happens every frame when it's time to draw graphical components to
  the screen. This is the only event under which resources should be
  drawn to the screen.

window_resize
  Data type: Events::RudimentaryEventWrapper<math::Vector2D>

  This will be called when the user resizes the play window. Don't do
  anything too intensive here, and note that it will be called repeatedly
  during the resizing :/ I'll look into changing this, but for now we
  have to deal with it as is.
