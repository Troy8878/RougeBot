Installer
---------
I need to go over the old installer and make sure it still works
before I can decide whether the TCRs are alright


Menus
-----
BASIC: Options Menu - Audio mute


Startup
-------
PROFESSIONAL: I'm unsure if my spinning circle meets "Slick Transitions"


Resolution
----------
BASIC: The combat/item log clips off the side at minimum aspect ratio
ADVANCED: Resolution Switching. Not sure if worth it.


Miscellaneous
-------------
INTERMEDIATE: Audio must lower volume on pause menu
ADVANCED: Make a website. lol


Testing and Tracking
--------------------
BASIC: Autoplay. Fuck it, hook an AI up to the player and let them go nuts.
Let's be honest, we don't have time for the rest of it.
